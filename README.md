Some stuff for manipulating EXIF in place (not touching a single byte of
the file not strictly required for the requested change).

Unlike everything else I can find for changing EXIF fields this is unlikely
to break makernotes and other things it doesn't know about.

Also comes with a program to extract/replace the preview jpeg in some raw
formats.
